# EVM-Scaffold-Base-Application [![twitter URL](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/https/twitter.com/seranged.svg?style=social&label=Follow%20%40seranged)](https://twitter.com/seranged)

This repo is a barebones NextJS application that withholds alot of code that is pulled in via the [EVM-Scaffolding-CLI](https://github.com/Seranged/EVM-Scaffolding-CLI) flow. This repo serves no purpose other than that and it is not useful in any other way.

If you want to bootstrap a EVM frontend, it is suggested you run `npx evm-scaffolding-cli` inside your terminal. If you want somthing easier which isn't asking you what dependancies to install, I suggest you `git clone https://github.com/Seranged/EVM-FE-Bootstrap.git`
